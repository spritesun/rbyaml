= Introduction =

YAML is a significant ruby library. It is used generally, like as RubyGems and RoR, etc.
To implement YAML processor by pure ruby, that means it can be used by most alternative ruby implementations directly.

= Details =

YAML has reached 1.2 level, but Syck has no maintainer now. Syck, as a significant part of it being implemented in C, most alternative ruby implementations can not use it directly.
A more mature and more efficient processor could be necessary. For nearly all the Ruby projects are worked with YAML.
Being implemented in pure ruby means it can be integrated with bottom ruby implementation comfortably, it will be a good choice for various ruby implementations, just like CRuby, rubinius, JRuby and XRuby.
